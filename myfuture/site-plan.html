      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will be making a portfolio website to show to potential future employers.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is professionals, companies, and other folk who may be interested in hiring me for a job.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        First of all, welcome. I’m Tate. A university student taking computer science. You might be a professor, friend (or soon to be friend), or an industry professional. Regardless of your background, here you will learn about me and my background.
      </p>
      <p>My experience varies quite largely from what you may expect from the average person. Spreading across a range of technology to physical labour, I am what you may consider a worker bee in the eyes of the world. Oftentimes I do what’s needed, and then some. 
        </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in a small town in Southern Alberta, Canada, I lived what I like to call the “good life.” I was born and raised in that town, and I don’t regret a single minute of it. Humble beginnings, but a good start to a long and prosperous life; raised to good ideals, and a strong sense of responsibility, I’m ready to take on the world.
      </p>
      <p>Throw whatever contact information I can find on here and a couple points with images relating to the other two pages. Essentially, the home page will use the above points as a summary for the pages, but visiting the other pages will extrapolate upon more information.</p>
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Past Experience</h3>
      <p>
        A majority of my work experience comes from physical jobs, instilling a strong sense of work ethic, as working within and beyond the capabilities of your body when required is a humbling experience. For the sake of not doxxing myself, specific details can be acquired by contacting me personally.
      </p>
      <p>By far, my favourite job I have had so far has to be the municipal job I had in the summers for the past two years. At first, the town was very hesitant to take me on as a worker, having several people brought on their team already. Regardless of that, after interviewing me (and believe me, it wasn’t the best interview, I’ll say that much), they reached out to me, and offered me a job. Having been 16 at the time, I was excited but dreaded the long summer ahead of me. The job wasn’t necessarily hard, per se, but it was draining. They had us maintaining the town property; mowing, weed whipping, painting lines on the football field, running town events, and so on. It wasn’t long before the summer heat and sun beating down on me taught me to wear sunscreen and drink loads of water/gatorade. But as time passed and I got more used to the work, the more and more I heard good things about what I was doing. By the time the summer was drawing to a close, the town wanted me back next year, even going so far as to remind me to apply when the time came. Needless to say, this most recent year was just as successful.</p>

      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My future has never really been planned out too far; I accept what comes at face value. While there has been a general outline of where things are going, it’s no different from anyone else’s in this day and age: Grow up, get educated, make money, establish a life. There’s always a little more to the picture, though.
      </p>
      <p>Ever since I was young, technology has been a hobby of mine, restricted as it was by my mother for the sake of my social life and purity as a child. Notwithstanding that, I still had times when I was able to experience the magic of technology; be it playing a Nintendo Entertainment System on my Grandmother’s CRT TV, or the Xbox 360 at my childhood friend’s house. It was only once I matured a bit more that I truly started looking into technology itself, instead of just the games. Ultimately, my portal into the technological world came from two things: Youtube, and my father, (it seems to run in the family, as both of my brothers are in computer science too, me being the youngest). In my senior years of high school, I did as much as I could relating to technology, going so far as to work for my high school itself. To this day, I still have so much to learn about it, but that excites me. I look forward to growing my knowledge and putting it to use.</p>
